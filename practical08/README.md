This folder contains completed C and Fortran code for the Week 8 practical.

During this practical we implemented Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor between two positive integers. The algorithm was implemented using an iterative approach and a recursive approach.

### C code

Run gcd.c:

```
gcc -o gcd_c gcd.c
./gcd_c
```

### Fortran code

Run gcd.f90:

```
gfortran -o gcd_f gcd.f90
./gcd_f
```
